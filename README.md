Resume as a Service (RaaS)
=====================
*Under Construction*
This is a single page resume website optimized for devops engineers.

This serves as a great project to get started with some common technologies for
the field. I'll go over the entire stack with you below.

Sample Site
-----------
A demo lives [here](https://jessebot.io).

Setting up your own RaaS
-------------------------
Modify the `config.json` file for your own metadata.

If you want CI/CD to work, you'll need to modify the circleci file here.

For help developing and testing
-----------------------------
*Shameless call for code friends*: Tired of never having anything to point to
outside of your closed source projects for other companies? Why not contribute
and play with my project! :D

Together, we'll have the cheapest, fastest, most scalable, and highly available
resumes, and we will get all the jobs!

(I actually already have a job, but I like this project.)

See the `README.md` in the `k8s_minimum` directory for getting this up and
running on Kubernetes! :)
